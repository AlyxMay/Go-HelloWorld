## Getting Started

This video is me trying to create from day one on printing to a terminal to running and building on a binary file.


### Built with
- VS code
- Chromebook plus OS
- Go language 

### Installing
Assuming you have GO installed.
Downloading the main.go file and in the terminal find where the file is once done write the following in the terminal:


    go run main.go

or you can create the file and run the file with:

    go build main.go
then write

    ./main
and then file will run as a binary file.
